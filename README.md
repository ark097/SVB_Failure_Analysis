**Abstract**

Silicon Valley Bank's downfall has become a multifaceted concern that has piqued the interest of numerous analysts and researchers. This study aims to pinpoint the essential factors that contributed to the downfall of Silicon Valley Bank including, but not limited to a bank's portfolio distribution, risk management and hedging strategies, as well as their capacity to manage short-term capital requirements. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of continuously monitoring these factors to prevent future incidents in the banking sector.

**Introduction**

On March 10th, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed, causing a ripple effect of other bank failures, including prominent names like Signature Bank, Credit Suisse, and First Republic Bank. The prevailing belief is that a combination of economic, managerial, and regulatory factors contributed to the bank's collapse. The most recent failure of a bank of this size happened back in 2008, when Lehman Brothers, a leading investment bank in the United States, went bankrupt. This triggered a similar chain reaction of events that spread across the world, resulting in a widespread recession and is considered one of the worst financial crises in modern history.
The banking sector's vulnerability was likely the result of regulatory modifications made by the Trump administration that eliminated the requirement for banks with $100 to $250 billion in assets to hold enough high-quality liquid assets to cover anticipated net outflows during a stressful period. Consequently, such banks were authorized to invest more in riskier assets that were previously prohibited under older regulations.

**Results**

The report included in this repo presents the findings of our in-depth investigation of the circumstances surrounding the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Our analysis delves into the various factors that contributed to the bank's failure, such as inadequate capital and liquidity buffers, poor risk management,
and a challenging economic and regulatory environment. The results are based on a comprehensive examination of Silicon Valley Bank's income statements, balance sheets, summary ratios, and regulatory filings, compared against some of the banks in its peer group
